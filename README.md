# Water Schedule

### Overview

This is a Python command-line tool that generates a plan watering schedule for the next 12 weeks. This avoids weekends and only include weekdays (schedule_date.weekday() < 5:). Every day has an integer assigned to them, 0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday. Integer's 5 & 6 classed as weekend. Every plant is watered on Monday 28, the start date 'start_next_monday', and follows their water frequency.

### How To Use

To use this schedule, click on the link I have shared/provided and once the link is open, navigate the main code (main.py). After this stage, look for a run button or a play button (usually located on top right of script) and press it. You should see the output of the code in the terminal. The output should be the dates & the day (e.g. 2024-01-01 (Monday)) and the plant name next to it

### Bonus Attempt

I have attempted the bonus challenge but it didn't work so i used '#' to make it not able to run. Line 80 & 90 include elements contributing to the bonus challenge, whichis located from lines 95 to 100.
